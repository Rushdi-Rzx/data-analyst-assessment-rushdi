# Python Task

## Overview
This project involves analyzing sales data and providing insights. The main tasks include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced analysis.

## Files
- `sales_data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `python_task.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data cleaning, EDA, and advanced analysis.

## Instructions
1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the `python_task` directory.
3. Open the `python_task.ipynb` notebook to perform the analysis.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the `python_task` directory:
2. Start Jupyter Notebook/Google collab:
3. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, open `python_task.ipynb`.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the analysis.

## Approach
1. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values.
    - Ensured appropriate data types for each column.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Calculated the total sales for each order.
    - Determined the top 5 products by total sales.
    - Identified the monthly sales trend.
    - Plotted a bar chart for the top 5 products by total sales.
3. **Advanced Analysis**:
    - Calculated the average order value (AOV).
    - Determined the repeat purchase rate.
